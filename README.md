# Health Care Robot
This github project is about how we make a working robot and help people all around the world.
This robot will provide health care services if it hears or senses someone in pain, distress, etc.
Once everything is done, we can make more of these robots and help save someone.

## Keyword Recognition
The robot will respond to a series of main key-words/sounds, and then assess the situation visually and auditorally. If possible, the robot will prompt for additional instructions, and if none are given, will take the most reasonable action it can.
